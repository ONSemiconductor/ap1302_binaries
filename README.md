# AP1302 Image Signal Processor Initialization Binaries
Here you can find binaries to use with onsemi AP1302 Image Signal Processor for various onsemi image sensor parts. These binaries are primarily intended to be used with AP1302 Linux driver, but can be used elsewhere.

The most recent binaries are in the "generic" folder. Please use these with up-to-date ap1302.c driver. The most evolved driver at the moment of writing this can be found here: https://github.com/Avnet/ap1302-driver.
Note that binaries provided here do not include header which the ap1302.c driver currently requires. It has been asked to make header optional so that binaries can be used directly: https://github.com/Avnet/ap1302-driver/commit/bca781bb99238f420ad99fe77da2e7824339f971#commitcomment-103175871.
